The ESP32-S3 is based on an Xtensa¨ LX7 series microprocessor.6.1 Xtensa¨ Dual-Core 32bit LX7 MicroprocessorThe microprocessor for the ESP32-S3 SoC inside the NORA-W106 module is a dual-core 32-bit Xtensa¨ LX7. Each core can run at up to 240 MHz and has 512 kB SRAM memory. The LX7 features:32-bit customized instruction set128-bit data bus32-bit multiplier / dividerThe LX7 has a 384 kB ROM (Read Only Memory), and 512 kB of SRAM (Static Random Access Memory). It also features an 8 kB RTC FAST and RTC SLOW memory. These memories are designed for low-power operations, where the SLOW memory can be accessed by the ULP (Ulta Low Power) coprocessor, retaining the data in deep sleep mode.6.2 Wi-Fi¨The NORA-W106-10B module supports the Wi-Fi¨ 4 IEEE 802.11 standards b/g/n, with an output power EIRP at up to 10 dBm. The max range for this module is 500 meters.802.11b: 11 Mbit/s802.11g: 54 Mbit/s802.11n: 72 Mbit/s max at HT-20 (20 MHz), 150 Mbit/s max at HT-40 (40 MHz)6.3 Bluetooth¨The NORA-W106-10B module supports Bluetooth¨ LE v5.0 with an output power EIRP at up to 10 dBm and data rates up to 2 Mbps. It has the option to scan and advertise simultaneously, as well as supporting multiple connections in peripheral/central mode.
6.4 PSRAMThe NORA-W106-10B module includes 8 MB of embedded PSRAM. (Octal SPI)6.5 Antenna GainThe built-in antenna on the NORA-W106-10B module uses GFSK modulation technique, with the performance ratings listed below:Wi-Fi¨:Typical conducted output power: 17 dBm.Typical radiated output power: 20 dBm EIRP.Conducted sensitivity: -97 dBm.Bluetooth¨ Low Energy:Typical conducted output power: 7 dBm.Typical radiated output power: 10 dBm EIRP.Conducted sensitivity: -98 dBm.This data is retrieved from the uBlox NORA-W10 data sheet (page 7, section 1.5) available here.7 System7.1 ResetsThe ESP32-S3 has support for four levels of reset:CPU: resets CPU0/CPU1 coreCore: resets the digital system, except for the RTC peripherals (ULP coprocessor, RTC memory).System: resets the entire digital system, including the RTC peripherals.Chip: resets the entire chip.It is possible to conduct a software reset of this board, as well as obtaining the reset reason.To do a hardware reset of the board, use the onboard reset button (PB1).107.2 TimersThe Nano ESP32 has the following timers:52-bit system timer with 2x 52-bit counters (16 MHz) and 3x comparators.4x general-purpose 54-bit timers3x watchdog timers, two in main system (MWDT0/1), one in the RTC module (RWDT).7.3 InterruptsAll GPIOs on the Nano ESP32 can be configured to be used as interrupts, and is provided by an interrupt matrix.Interrupt pins are configured on an application level, using the following configurations:LOWHIGHCHANGEFALLINGRISING8 Serial Communication ProtocolsThe ESP32-S3 chip provides flexibility for the various serial protocols it supports. For example, the I2C bus can be assigned to almost any available GPIO.8.1 Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C)Default pins:A4 - SDAA5 - SCLThe I2C bus is by default assigned to the A4/A5 (SDA/SCL) pins for retro compatibility. This pin assignment can however be changed, due to the flexibility of the ESP32-S3 chip.The SDA and SCL pins can be assigned to most GPIOs, however some of these pins may have other essential functions that prevents I2C operations to run successfully.Please note: many software libraries uses the standard pin assignment (A4/A5).8.2 Inter-IC Sound (I2S)There two I2S controllers that are typically used for communication with audio devices. There are no specific pins assigned for I2S, this can be used by any free GPIO.Using standard or TDM mode, the following lines are used:MCLK - master clockBCLK - bit clockWS - word selectDIN/DOUT - serial dataUsing PDM mode:CLK - PDM clockDIN/DOUT serial dataRead more about the I2S protocol in Espressif's Peripheral API - InterIC Sounds (I2S)8.3 Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)SCK - D13CIPO - D12COPI - D11 CS - D10The SPI controller is by default assigned to the pins above.8.4 Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART)D1 / TXD0 / RXThe UART controller is by default assigned to the the pins above.8.5 Two Wire Automotive Interface (TWAI¨)The CAN/TWAI¨ controller is used to communicate with systems using the CAN/TWAI¨ protocol, particularly common in the automotive industry. There are no specific pins assigned for the CAN/TWAI¨ controller, any free GPIO can be used.Please note: TWAI¨ is also known as the CAN2.0B, or "CAN classic". The CAN controller is NOT compatible with CAN FD frames.9 External Flash MemoryNano ESP32 features a 128 Mbit (16 MB) external flash, the GD25B128EWIGR (U3). This memory is connected to the ESP32 via Quad Serial Peripheral Interface (QSPI).The operating frequency for this IC is 133 MHz, and has a data transfer rate at up to 664 Mbit/s.10 USB ConnectorThe Nano ESP32 has one USB-C¨ port, used to power and program your board as well as sending & receiving serial communication.Note that you should not power the board with more than 5 V via the USB-C¨ port.11 Power OptionsPower can either be supplied via the VIN pin, or via USB-C¨ connector. Any voltage input either via USB or VIN is stepped down to 3.3 V using the MP2322GQH (U2) converter.The operating voltage for this board is 3.3 V. Please note that there's no 5V pin available on this board, only the VBUS can provide 5 V when the board is powered via USB.11.1 Power TreeArduino Nano ESP32 power tree.11.2 Pin VoltageAll digital & analog pins on the Nano ESP32 are 3.3 V. Do not connect any higher voltage devices to any of the pins as it will risk damaging the board.11.3 VIN RatingThe recommended input voltage range is 6-21 V.You should not attempt to power the board with a voltage outside the recommended range, particularly not higher than 21 V.The efficiency of the converter depends on the input voltage via the VIN pin. See the average below for a board operation with normal current consumption:4.5 V - >90%.12 V - 85-90%18 V - <85%This information is extracted from the MP2322GQH's datasheet.11.4 VBUSThere is no 5V pin available on the Nano ESP32. 5 V can only be provided via the VBUS, which is supplied directly from the USB-C¨ power source.While powering the board via the VIN pin, the VBUS pin is not activated. This means you have no option of providing 5 V from the board unless powered via USB or externally.11.5 Using the 3.3 V PinThe 3.3 V pin is connected to the 3.3 V rail which is connected to the output of the MP2322GQH step down converter. This pin is primarily used to power external components.11.6 Pin CurrentThe GPIOs on the Nano ESP32 can handle source currents up to 40 mA, and sink currents up to 28 mA. Never connect devices that draw higher current directly to a GPIO.Mechanical Information12 Pinout
